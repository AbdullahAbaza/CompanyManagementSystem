# Company Management System

## Overview
The **Company Management System** is a robust solution designed to optimize and streamline the management of company operations. Built using a layered architecture, the system enhances maintainability and scalability, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between different components.

## Architecture

### Three-Layer Architecture
This application is organized into three primary layers, each with a distinct responsibility:

1. **Presentation Layer (MVC)**  
   Responsible for handling user interactions, the presentation layer separates the user interface from the business logic by implementing the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern. This ensures that the UI logic is cleanly separated from core application functionality.

2. **Business Logic Layer (Pessimistic Logic)**  
   The business logic layer encapsulates the core functionality of the application. It employs **pessimistic locking** to maintain data integrity and consistency during transactions, ensuring that concurrent operations do not lead to conflicts.

3. **Data Access Layer**  
   The data access layer abstracts interaction with the database. By centralizing all data access logic, it simplifies database operations, making the system easier to maintain and modify when needed.

## Design Patterns Implemented
This system integrates several well-established design patterns to promote scalability, maintainability, and ease of development:

- **Generic Repository**: A generic interface for data access that reduces code duplication and enhances reusability across different data entities.
- **Unit of Work**: Manages database transactions, ensuring that changes are committed atomically, and reducing the risk of data inconsistency.
- **AutoMapper**: Automates object-to-object mapping, significantly reducing the amount of boilerplate code and improving readability.
- **Dependency Injection**: Promotes loose coupling between components, making the system modular, easier to test, and more flexible for future development.
- **File Handling Extension Methods**: Provides utility methods for file operations, simplifying file handling and ensuring consistent practices throughout the application.

## Technologies Used
This system utilizes the following technologies:

- **ASP.NET Core** for the web application framework.
- **Entity Framework** for object-relational mapping and data access.
- **AutoMapper** for automatic object mapping.
- **Dependency Injection** framework for managing object lifecycles and dependencies.
